  Hello

<p>syntax are the rules for how a code language like html should be written</p>

<p>If you think of any language like English we have something called grammar which is the rules of the language(for code)</p>

<p>The biggest difference between a language like english and a coding language is that in in englsh you dont have to follow the rules of the grammer perfectly people can still understand you.While in coding if you dont follow the rules of the syntax the computer won't understand your code</p>

<p>HTML atrribute modifies how an element behaves-just like href atrribute above</p>

<p> So the Syntax rule for an atrribute are, we have to have a space between the atrribute and the tag name</p>

<p>href is the attributes name(What we are modifying is-html element-a) while inside the double quotes is the value of the attribute(What we are modifying.. it to - Youtube.com)</p>

<p>We can also have multiple attributes on an element.To add another attribute we just seperate it with space</p>

<p>You can add another attribute called Target which determines whether the link opens in the current page or in a new tab</p>

<p> By defalt if we don't have the target attribute it opens in the current page but if we set the target attribute to _blank now the link will open in a new tab</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the href and the target attributes only work on the link element, the button and the paragraph elements have their own set of attributes that one can modify</p>

<p>Adding Extra spaces in html page only assits you to organise your work but the extra spaces will be ignored while displaying on the website
